You will need to design and create your own DAO classes from scratch. 
You should refer to prior mini-project lab examples and course material for guidance.

Please refrain from using a 'try-with-resources' block when connecting to your database. 
The ConnectionUtil provided uses a singleton, and using a try-with-resources will cause issues in the tests.
